Lines 21 and 17 are the two innermost loops we are interested in.
From the output we can see that 0.21 seconds was spent on the first loop (sum1=sum1+dx*i*j;)
and 0.27 seconds was spent on the second loop (sum2=sum2+cos(exp(sin(dx*i*j)));).
Since the second loop performs more complex calculations, it's natural for it to take up a bit more time.
