p03

I tested the program p03.c on an Intel i5-7400 quad core cpu with n = 100000000 

Output from the program p03.c:
res1: 67108864.000000
cpu_time for 32 bit float: 1.444415
res2: 127022572.830602
cpu_time for 64 bit float: 2.435753
res3: 127022572.800286
cpu_time for 128 bit float: 22.848177

Interestingly the difference in CPU time it to execute the task is not really significant between the 32 bit and 64 bit float.
However, for the 128 bit float the CPU time is significantly greater.
