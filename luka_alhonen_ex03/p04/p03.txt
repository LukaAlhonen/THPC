CPU time is a measurement of the time the CPU has spent running the code, whereas Wall clock time 
is the actual amount of time the program to to execute.

Measurements were taken on a M2 MacBook air with either of these two functions doing most of the work:
void expensive_operation(int n)
void expensive_operation_print(int n)

n = 9900000
With printf inside for loop:
Time elapsed actual time: 29.701232 s
Elapsed CPU time: 8.260767 s

n = 9900000
Without printf inside for loop:
Time elapsed actual time: 0.095437 s
Elapsed CPU time: 0.097351 s

n = 999000000
Without printf inside for loop:
Time elapsed actual time: 8.143330 s
Elapsed CPU time: 8.122441 s

As one can see the function that has a printf statement inside the loop is significantly significantly more expensive. 
Also since CPU time does not include the time spent waiting for IO operations the function, 
the difference between wall clock time and cpu time is much greater for the function with the 
printf statement than for the one without it.
