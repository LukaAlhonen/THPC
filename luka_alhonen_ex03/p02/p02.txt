All tests were run on a system with an Intel Core i5-7400 with 4 cores and 8gb of memory

a)
The source code line that consumed the most CPU time was line 88 inside the GetForces function 
in the file forces.c (8.10 seconds)

Here is the output from gprof:
%   cumulative   self              self     total           
time   seconds   seconds    calls  Ts/call  Ts/call  name    
11.96      8.10     8.10                             GetForces (forces.c:88 @ 404d07)

And here is the line of code:
/* Then get a=F/m in units of ï¿½/fs^2 */
dVdr=(dVdr/(m*u))/aunit/r;

b)
Most of the CPU time was spent in the GetForces function in the forces.c file (39.82 seconds)

Here is the output from gprof:
