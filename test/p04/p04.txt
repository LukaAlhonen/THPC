Since target1 depends on target2, which depends on target3, which depends on target1, 
a circular dependency occurs. This is demonstrated in the makefile.

Since all files depend on files that do not exist yet make throws the following error:
make: Circular target3 <- target1 dependency dropped.
cp target1 target3
cp: target1: No such file or directory
make: *** [target3] Error 1
